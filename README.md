# etch-a-sketch

This is my implementation of The Odin Project's Etch-a-Sketch project. Everything was written by me from scratch, with no guides or walkthroughs. I did occasionally have help from the wonderful TOP community, though!

Right now, everything works as intended, However, I need to add buttons for an eraser, and to switch back to the default black drawing color. 

This was a fun project, and I'm proud of it for what it is.
